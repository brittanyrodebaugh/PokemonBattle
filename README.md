# PokemonBattle
PokemonBattle is a text based game that allows you to choose a Pokemon and battle a random wild Pokemon. You choose an attack each turn until the chosen/wild Pokemon's health is at 0. Once the battle is complete, you can choose to start over or exit the program. 

## Features
1) Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter
commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
- The Game is within a master loop. The loop continues if you choose to restart the game and ends if you decide to exit the game. 
2) Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent.
3) Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it
in your program.
4)Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
